#  THE MAN WHO CHANGED ARSENAL FOOTBALL CLUB  

## Arsene Wenger

### Why I decided to write a tribute for Arsene Wenger  
  
Arsenal is me and I am Arsenal. Arsene Wenger made this happen. I fell in love with Arsenal between the years 2003 - 2004. This season Arsenal went a whole year unbeaten, something that was never
achieved. At this point i fell in love with Arsenal football club and Arsene Wenger. Falling in love was the easy part and staying in love should have been the difficult part but Arsene was a very charismatic man. He spent 24years at Arsenal and every year my love for Arsenal grew bigger and bigger. This is why I decided to write a tribute for the man that made me fall in love with the best
team in london.  

### The Journey So Far. 
  
It's amazing how the brain works and how much you can learn if you put the effort into it.üòÅ My Html and Css skills have improved enough for me to be able to make this tribute page. Also, i was able
learn the basics of the best version control(git). I was able to use this to track changes to my project and also push my project to a remote repositry.  This is a journey I am really enjoying so far and i can't wait to get started at the prestigious School of Code.
